"""After making this one, I think this one is more accurate actually.. 
Its simple, doesn't crash and outputs in a similar manner to the way 
christian Ã¥berg has it in the compendium. 
Takes less input. Don't need to dick around with a menu. Could simply 
run the program all over again if anything needs to be changed amongst 
the input from the user.
